This map is centered around NYC, giving an overview of all the districts in NYC along with the descriptions. It also marked the top 10 Michelin restaurants in NYC.
This map can be used for tourism where it has descriptions for all the districts in NYC. It can give an overview of each district to tourists so they can get an idea of what they can do in different neighborhoods.
For instance, if they want to shop for designer clothings, they can go to SOHO. In addition, NYC have a variety of food, as well as many Michelin starred restaurants. The top 10 Michelin in 2021 is marked, along with the
descriptions and website links, so the tourists can have an idea of what kind of food the restaurants serve then decide which one they want to go and make reservations online. 
The base map I chose was Open Street Map, because first, this map shows all the street names and have obvious highway names, which would be helpful for tourists to find locations based on the streets. Secondly, majority 
of the stores, cafe, bus stop, public utilities etc. are labeled out, so tourists can easily find a place based on their needs according to their locations. Last but not least, even though there're detailed street names and the 
streets are colored, they're useful for the tourists to identify different streets and despite this, there isnt any other colors/icons that are too distractive to get the information the tourists need.
